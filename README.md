# Garment Employee Productivity project
This project aims to analyze and build a prediction model on the Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees Data Set. This is a course project.
In this project, we have built an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash and a web app to deploy the prediction model using Streamlit. We have also create a beautiful dashboard to include the graphs during the EDA process:

## Installation
Use the following commands:

```git clone https://github.com/Tam1032/Garment-Employee-Productivity.git```

After that, use the following command to install the necessary libraries in Python. You can create a virtual Anaconda environment to avoid errors.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Plot the interactive dashboard
You can plot the interactive dashboard using this command:

```python app.py```

After that, copy the 'http' address on the console and paste it on a web browser like Google and you can freely interact with the dashboard to understand more about the dataset.
## Run the web app
You can run the web app via this command:

```streamlit run predictor.py```

After that, the interface will appear and you can fill the information to see the prediction.
